<!-- SLIDE: pain_point | layout: three_column | title: "Pain Point 1: Redemption Preferences Are Hidden, Driving 7 Calls" -->

## Pain Point 1: Redemption Preferences Are Hidden, Driving 7 Calls

**What's happening:** Customers are defaulted into receiving points when they want statement credits for their cashback rewards, but they cannot find a way to change this preference in the app or online.
**The evidence:** 7 separate customers called because their cashback was posted as points, and they were unable to locate any self-service option to modify this setting for future rewards.
**Call volume:** 7 calls | 43.75% of total
**The fix:** Build a dedicated 'Redemption Preferences' section in the app and web portal to allow customers to easily select and confirm their default cashback method.

<!-- SLIDE: pain_point | layout: three_column | title: "Pain Point 2: Bonus Categories Are Unclear, Driving 4 Calls" -->

## Pain Point 2: Bonus Categories Are Unclear, Driving 4 Calls

**What's happening:** Customers are making purchases expecting category bonuses (e.g., 5x on gas) but are not receiving them because the merchant is coded in an unexpected way (e.g., 'convenience store').
**The evidence:** 4 customers called after checking their statements and seeing they did not receive bonus points for purchases they believed were in-category. There is no digital tool to show them why the transaction didn't qualify.
**Call volume:** 4 calls | 25.0% of total
**The fix:** Display the Merchant Category Code (MCC) on every transaction detail page and provide a clear explanation if a bonus was or was not applied.

<!-- SLIDE: pain_point | layout: three_column | title: "Pain Point 3: Welcome Bonus Tracking is Missing, Driving 2 Calls" -->

## Pain Point 3: Welcome Bonus Tracking is Missing, Driving 2 Calls

**What's happening:** New cardmembers are not receiving the correct welcome bonus points after meeting the required spend, creating distrust and forcing them to call for manual review and correction.
**The evidence:** 2 customers called because they signed up for a 60,000 point offer but only received 40,000, with no digital way to track their progress or the bonus payout status.
**Call volume:** 2 calls | 12.5% of total
**The fix:** Implement an in-app 'Offer Tracker' showing progress toward the spend requirement, the bonus amount, and the expected crediting date.

<!-- SLIDE: theme_narrative | layout: callout_stat | title: "Rewards & Loyalty: The Story" -->

## Rewards & Loyalty: The Story

Customers are actively trying to manage their rewards digitally but are consistently met with missing features and a lack of transparency. Simple tasks like setting a preference, tracking a bonus, or understanding why points weren't awarded are impossible without calling an agent. This transforms what should be routine self-service into a high-effort, trust-eroding experience that drives 100% of the calls in this analysis.
