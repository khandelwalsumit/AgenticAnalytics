<!-- SLIDE: pain_point | layout: three_column | title: "Pain Point 1: Partner Transfers Are a Black Box (4 Calls)" -->

## Pain Point 1: Partner Transfers Are a Black Box (4 Calls)

**What's happening:** Customers are calling because points transferred from partners are not appearing in their accounts, and they have no way to track the status of these transfers.
**The evidence:** 4 separate customers called specifically to ask "Where are my transferred points?", indicating a total lack of in-app visibility for in-progress partner transactions.
**Call volume:** 4 calls | 25% of total
**The fix:** Build a 'pending transfers' or 'transfer history' section in the rewards dashboard showing status and estimated completion dates.

<!-- SLIDE: pain_point | layout: three_column | title: "Pain Point 2: Promotional Points Are Missing (3 Calls)" -->

## Pain Point 2: Promotional Points Are Missing (3 Calls)

**What's happening:** Customers are not receiving expected promotional points and have no digital tools to understand why they didn't qualify or to track their progress towards earning them.
**The evidence:** 3 customers called because a promised bonus for specific actions was not credited, forcing an agent to manually investigate eligibility.
**Call volume:** 3 calls | 18.75% of total
**The fix:** Implement an in-app promotional offer tracker with a clear checklist of qualifying criteria and a self-service diagnostic tool.

## Pain Point 3: Basic Points Crediting Lacks Transparency (3 Calls)

**What's happening:** Customers are calling about routine points from transactions not being credited, as there is no way for them to see points that are "in-progress" or "pending."
**The evidence:** 3 customers called about points from recent transactions not appearing, a problem that a simple "pending" status would have solved without an agent.
**Call volume:** 3 calls | 18.75% of total
**The fix:** Add a 'pending points' view in the rewards dashboard with estimated posting dates for all recent transactions.

## Rewards & Loyalty: The Story

Customers are successfully earning rewards but are forced to call support because the digital experience fails to provide basic visibility into their status. Questions like "Where are my points from my partner transfer?" or "Why didn't I get my bonus?" are entirely preventable and currently make up 100% of the analyzed call volume, eroding trust and creating unnecessary operational costs.

## If Nothing Changes

Without providing basic in-app visibility for transfers, promotions, and crediting, all 16 of these monthly callers will continue to require agent support, eroding customer trust and creating a service cost that scales directly with the growth of the loyalty program.
