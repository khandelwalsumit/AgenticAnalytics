## Pain Point 1: Promotional Points Are Missing, Driving 19% of Calls

**What's happening:** Customers are not receiving expected promotional points and have no way to check their eligibility or progress online, forcing them to call for a status update.
**The evidence:** 3 separate calls were driven by a complete lack of a self-service path to view active promotions or track progress toward earning rewards.
**Call volume:** 3 calls | 18.75% of total
**The fix:** Implement an in-app offer tracker with a progress bar and clear qualifying criteria checklist for active promotions.

## Pain Point 2: Category Bonuses Are Not Applied, Driving 13% of Calls

**What's happening:** Customers are confused when expected category-specific bonuses don't appear on their statements, indicating a lack of transparency in the user interface.
**The evidence:** 2 calls were driven by customers unable to see why a transaction did not receive a bonus, due to unclear earn rates and bonus caps in the app.
**Call volume:** 2 calls | 12.5% of total
**The fix:** Display per-transaction earn rates and category bonus caps with progress tracking directly in the transaction history.

<!-- SLIDE: theme_narrative | layout: callout_stat | title: "Rewards & Loyalty: The Story" -->

## Rewards & Loyalty: The Story

Customers are calling because the digital experience creates a blind spot around rewards. They expect to self-serve for promotion status and bonus calculations but are forced to contact an agent when the app and website fail to provide this basic transparency. These are not complex policy issues; they are digital product gaps.

## If Nothing Changes

Without a self-service path for tracking promotions and bonuses, the 5 customers identified in this analysis will continue to call, and this volume will scale directly with every new loyalty campaign launched. This friction undermines the positive engagement that the loyalty program is designed to create.
