<!-- SLIDE: pain_point | layout: three_column | title: "Pain Point 1: Redemption Preferences Are Buried, Driving 7 Calls" -->

## Pain Point 1: Redemption Preferences Are Buried, Driving 7 Calls

**What's happening:** Customers are unable to find or set their cashback redemption preference, resulting in rewards being issued in a format they don't want (e.g., points instead of a statement credit).
**The evidence:** 7 separate callers stated they could not locate the setting, forcing them to call an agent to make the change.
**Call volume:** 7 calls | 43.75% of total
**The fix:** Elevate the redemption preference setting to the main rewards dashboard, making it a 1-tap action with a "Set as default" option.

<!-- SLIDE: pain_point | layout: three_column | title: "Pain Point 2: Category Bonus Rules Are Unclear, Driving 3 Calls" -->

## Pain Point 2: Category Bonus Rules Are Unclear, Driving 3 Calls

**What's happening:** Customers are not receiving the 5x category bonus for gas purchases because the merchant is incorrectly coded as a 'convenience store' in the backend system.
**The evidence:** Customers explicitly stated they used their card at a gas pump but only received the base earn rate, causing confusion and a sense of being short-changed.
**Call volume:** 3 calls | 18.75% of total
**The fix:** Enhance the transaction crediting system with more sophisticated merchant code mapping and show customers the assigned code for each transaction in-app.

<!-- SLIDE: pain_point | layout: three_column | title: "Pain Point 3: Welcome Bonuses Are Under-Credited, Driving 2 Calls" -->

## Pain Point 3: Welcome Bonuses Are Under-Credited, Driving 2 Calls

**What's happening:** New customers are meeting the spend requirements for a 60,000 point welcome bonus but are only receiving 40,000 points.
**The evidence:** 2 customers called after their first statement to report a 20,000-point discrepancy, indicating a systemic failure in the promotion's crediting logic.
**Call volume:** 2 calls | 12.5% of total
**The fix:** Audit the welcome bonus crediting system to identify and fix the logic error causing under-payment and add a real-time spend tracker to the user dashboard.

## Rewards & Loyalty: The Story

Customers are calling because the rewards program feels unpredictable and untrustworthy. From bonuses not crediting correctly to preferences being ignored, the core promise of the program is being undermined by operational and digital friction. These are not one-off issues; they are systemic problems driving 100% of the calls analyzed, forcing customers to become auditors of their own loyalty.

## If Nothing Changes

Without addressing these foundational issues, every new customer acquired is another potential caller. The 7 customers unable to change their preferences will continue to call, and the broken bonus logic will continue to erode trust and create detractors at the very start of the customer relationship.
