# Transaction & Statement Analysis Skill

## Focus Areas
- Transaction history access and visibility
- Statement downloads and delivery
- Transaction discrepancies and missing entries
- Transaction search and filtering
- Mini-statement and detailed statement availability

## Key Fields to Analyze
- `exact_problem_statement` — Customer's specific transaction/statement issue
- `digital_friction` — Digital barriers to accessing transaction data
- `solution_by_ui` — UI improvements for transaction display
- `call_reason` → `granular_theme_l5` — Full call reason hierarchy

## Analysis Framework

### Step 1: Categorize by Issue Type
- **Access issues** — can't view transactions, page errors, loading failures
- **Display/format issues** — incorrect formatting, missing details, truncated descriptions
- **Data accuracy** — wrong amounts, incorrect dates, duplicate entries, missing transactions
- **Timing issues** — delayed posting, pending transaction confusion, settlement delays
- **Statement delivery** — email not received, download failures, format issues (PDF/CSV)

### Step 2: Identify Friction Points
- How many steps does it take to find a specific transaction?
- Are transaction descriptions meaningful or cryptic?
- Can customers filter/search effectively?
- Are pending vs posted transactions clearly distinguished?
- Is statement generation reliable and timely?

### Step 3: Map Solutions
- **UI fixes** — improved search, better transaction descriptions, filter options
- **Technology fixes** — faster statement generation, reliable email delivery
- **Education** — help customers understand settlement timelines, pending states

### Step 4: Measure Impact
- Volume of transaction/statement related calls
- Self-service potential (can customers find this in-app?)
- Repeat contact rate for same issue
- Customer satisfaction impact

## Investigation Questions
1. What are the top reasons customers call about transactions?
2. What percentage of transaction issues are findability problems vs data problems?
3. How often do customers call about "missing" transactions that are actually pending?
4. What statement formats are most requested?
5. Are transaction descriptions clear enough for customers to identify merchants?
6. What is the mobile vs web split for transaction access issues?
