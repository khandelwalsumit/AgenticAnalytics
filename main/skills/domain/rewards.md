# Rewards Analysis Skill

## Focus Areas
- Points and cashback tracking
- Redemption issues and failures
- Tier benefits and eligibility
- Reward expiry and forfeiture
- Promotional offers and discrepancies

## Key Fields to Analyze
- `exact_problem_statement` — Customer's specific rewards issue
- `digital_friction` — Digital barriers in rewards experience
- `solution_by_ui` — UI improvements for rewards visibility
- `policy_friction` — Policy friction in rewards programs
- `call_reason` → `granular_theme_l5` — Full call reason hierarchy

## Analysis Framework

### Step 1: Categorize by Reward Type
- **Points** — earning, tracking, missing points, incorrect crediting
- **Cashback** — cashback not received, incorrect amounts, eligibility confusion
- **Redemption** — redemption failures, limited options, conversion issues
- **Tier/Status** — tier qualification, benefits not applied, downgrade concerns
- **Promotions** — offer eligibility, coupon issues, terms confusion

### Step 2: Identify Friction Points
- Can customers easily see their rewards balance and history?
- Are earning rules transparent and understandable?
- Is the redemption process smooth and intuitive?
- Are expiry policies clearly communicated in advance?
- Do promotional terms match customer expectations?

### Step 3: Assess Impact
- Volume of rewards-related calls relative to total
- Revenue impact of rewards friction (churn risk, loyalty impact)
- Self-service potential for rewards inquiries
- Customer satisfaction with rewards programs

### Step 4: Map Solutions
- **UI** — rewards dashboard improvements, earning/burning history, expiry alerts
- **Policy** — clearer terms, grace periods, simplified tier rules
- **Education** — proactive reward balance notifications, how-to guides
- **Technology** — real-time points posting, automated expiry reminders

## Investigation Questions
1. What are the top rewards-related call reasons?
2. What percentage of rewards calls are about missing/incorrect points?
3. How discoverable is rewards information in digital channels?
4. What is the redemption failure rate and top failure reasons?
5. How often do customers call about rewards they didn't know they had?
6. Are reward expiry notifications sent with enough lead time?
