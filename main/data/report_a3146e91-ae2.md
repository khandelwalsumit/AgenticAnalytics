# Digital Friction Analysis: ATT

## Executive Summary

This analysis focuses on 4 ATT customer calls, specifically addressing 'Rewards Redemption' within the 'Rewards & Loyalty' theme. All identified friction points were preventable, indicating clear opportunities for operational, digital, and communication enhancements.

### Top 3 Critical Pain Points

**1. Welcome Bonus Tracker & Terms Clarity**
- Customers experience confusion due to a non-real-time welcome bonus tracker and bonus terms presented in fine print, making them difficult to access and understand on mobile devices.
- *Example:* Pattern: 1 call (25% of Rewards & Loyalty volume) specifically cited issues with the welcome bonus tracker not updating in real-time and terms being unreadable on mobile.
- **Call volume:** 1 call | 25.0% of total
- **Recommended:** Implement a real-time welcome bonus spend tracker on the rewards dashboard with a progress bar and clearly list qualifying/non-qualifying purchase categories.

**2. Anniversary Bonus Crediting Delays & Visibility**
- Customers report anniversary bonus points not being credited within expected timelines, coupled with a lack of visibility into bonus posting timelines and account anniversary dates within the app.
- *Example:* Pattern: 1 call (25% of Rewards & Loyalty volume) highlighted anniversary bonus points not being credited three months post-anniversary and no in-app visibility.
- **Call volume:** 1 call | 25.0% of total
- **Recommended:** Establish a clear SLA for anniversary bonus crediting, automate tracking and notifications, and prominently display bonus posting timelines and account anniversary dates in the app.

**3. Cashback Redemption Preference Confusion**
- Customers' cashback is incorrectly posted as points instead of statement credit, primarily due to a hidden and hard-to-locate redemption preference setting within the app.
- *Example:* Pattern: 1 call (25% of Rewards & Loyalty volume) detailed cashback being posted as points despite a preference for statement credit, with the setting buried deep in the app.
- **Call volume:** 1 call | 25.0% of total
- **Recommended:** Simplify the redemption preference setting by moving it to a top-level rewards section, adding a 'Set as default' option, and allowing auto-redemption rules.
