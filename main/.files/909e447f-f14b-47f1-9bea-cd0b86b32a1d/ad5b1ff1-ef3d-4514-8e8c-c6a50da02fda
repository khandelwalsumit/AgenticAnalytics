# Digital Friction Analysis: ATT

## Executive Summary

This analysis focuses on **500 ATT customer calls**, specifically those related to 'Rewards & Loyalty'. The investigation identified **1 core theme**, 'Rewards & Loyalty', which accounts for **16 calls**. All identified friction points are preventable, with **3 quick-win opportunities** identified by combining insights from Digital Friction and Communication lenses.

### Top 3 Critical Pain Points

**1. Rewards Redemption Preference Confusion**
- Customers frequently call due to an inability to change their rewards redemption preference between cashback and points, stemming from unclear communication and poor discoverability within the digital interface.
- *Example:* Data shows 7 calls (1.4% of total volume) specifically mention issues with finding or using the redemption preference settings.
- **Call volume:** 7 calls | 1.4% of total
- **Recommended:** Implement a prominent and easily discoverable section in the app for managing rewards redemption preferences, with clear instructions and options to switch between cashback and points.

**2. Category Bonus Discrepancies**
- Customers experience confusion and frustration when category bonuses are not applied as expected, often due to merchant coding discrepancies and a lack of transparent communication regarding how these codes impact bonus eligibility.
- *Example:* 4 calls (0.8% of total volume) highlight instances where customers did not receive expected category bonuses because merchants were coded differently than anticipated (e.g., gas station as convenience store).
- **Call volume:** 4 calls | 0.8% of total
- **Recommended:** Provide an in-app explainer or FAQ section detailing how merchant category codes affect bonus categories. Display the specific earn rate applied to each transaction in the transaction history.

**3. Unexplained Partial Welcome Bonuses**
- Customers are receiving only a portion of their promised welcome bonuses without any accompanying explanation, leading to dissatisfaction and calls for clarification.
- *Example:* 2 calls (0.4% of total volume) specifically report instances of receiving 40,000 points instead of the expected 60,000, with no explanation provided.
- **Call volume:** 2 calls | 0.4% of total
- **Recommended:** Implement an in-app offer tracker with a progress bar and clear criteria for bonus fulfillment. If a partial bonus is awarded, provide an immediate notification with a detailed explanation.
