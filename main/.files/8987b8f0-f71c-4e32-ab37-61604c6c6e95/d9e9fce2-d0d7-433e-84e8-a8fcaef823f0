# Digital Friction Analysis: ATT Rewards & Loyalty

## Executive Summary

This analysis focuses on 16 ATT customer calls related to Rewards & Loyalty issues, identifying critical friction points and opportunities for reduction. The data reveals a single, highly impactful theme driven by both digital friction and communication gaps.

### Top 3 Critical Pain Points

**1. Hidden Cashback Redemption Preferences**
- Customers frequently call because their cashback is posted as points instead of statement credit, struggling to locate and change their redemption preference due to deep navigation within the app.
- *Example:* Pattern: 7 calls specifically mention difficulty finding or setting a default cashback redemption method, leading to incorrect point postings.
- **Call volume:** 7 calls | 43.8% of total
- **Recommended:** Redesign the rewards section to bring redemption preference settings to a top-level menu, allowing customers to set a default redemption method (e.g., auto statement credit).

**2. Unclear Bonus Eligibility & MCC Visibility**
- Customers are confused about category bonus eligibility because the merchant category code (MCC) used for bonus determination is not visible, and bonus exclusions are unclear.
- *Example:* Pattern: 3 calls highlight frustration over not knowing why certain transactions didn't qualify for bonus points, citing a lack of MCC transparency.
- **Call volume:** 3 calls | 18.8% of total
- **Recommended:** Display the MCC and assigned category for each transaction, and provide clear explanations and examples for category bonus exclusions.

**3. Non-Real-time Welcome Bonus Tracking**
- The welcome bonus tracker does not show qualifying spend progress in real-time, updating only once per statement cycle, and bonus terms are difficult to read on mobile.
- *Example:* Pattern: 2 calls indicate customer anxiety and confusion due to the absence of real-time progress updates for their welcome bonus spend.
- **Call volume:** 2 calls | 12.5% of total
- **Recommended:** Implement a real-time welcome bonus spend tracker on the rewards dashboard with a progress bar and clear display of remaining days and qualifying purchase exclusions.
