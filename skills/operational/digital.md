# Digital Experience Analysis Skill

## Focus Areas
- UI/UX friction across mobile and web channels
- Feature findability and navigation issues
- Error messages and user guidance
- Mobile app vs web parity
- Accessibility and usability barriers

## Key Fields to Analyze
- `digital_friction` — Primary field for digital experience issues
- `solution_by_ui` — UI/UX change recommendations
- `solution_by_technology` — Technology improvements needed
- `call_reason` → `granular_theme_l5` — Call reason hierarchy for context

## Analysis Framework

### Step 1: Channel Segmentation
- **Mobile App** — iOS, Android, app version issues
- **Web/Desktop** — browser compatibility, responsive design, feature parity
- **Both** — cross-channel consistency issues, channel switching friction
- **Channel-specific gaps** — features available on one channel but not the other

### Step 2: Friction Type Classification
- **Findability** — customers can't find the feature they need
- **Usability** — feature exists but is confusing or error-prone
- **Performance** — slow loading, crashes, timeouts
- **Visibility** — information exists but is not surfaced prominently
- **Error handling** — unhelpful error messages, dead ends, no recovery path
- **Accessibility** — text size, contrast, screen reader support, language

### Step 3: Severity Assessment
- **Critical** — blocks the customer from completing their task entirely
- **Major** — causes significant confusion or requires multiple attempts
- **Minor** — inconvenience that doesn't prevent task completion
- **Enhancement** — improvement opportunity, not a current failure

### Step 4: Solution Mapping
- **Quick UI fixes** — button placement, label clarity, error messages
- **Feature additions** — new self-service capabilities, search improvements
- **Architecture changes** — navigation restructuring, information architecture
- **Technology investments** — performance optimization, platform upgrades

## Investigation Questions
1. What are the top digital friction themes by volume?
2. What is the mobile vs web split for digital friction calls?
3. Which features have the worst findability scores?
4. What percentage of calls could be eliminated with better UI?
5. Are error messages actionable (do they tell users what to do next)?
6. What is the overlap between digital friction and call reason categories?
7. Which digital improvements would have the highest self-service deflection?
