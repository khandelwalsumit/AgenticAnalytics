# Policy Analysis Skill

## Focus Areas
- Policy clarity and customer understanding
- Compliance gaps and enforcement issues
- Terms and conditions friction
- Customer communication about policies
- Policy exceptions and waiver patterns

## Key Fields to Analyze
- `policy_friction` — Primary field for policy-related friction
- `solution_by_education` — Customer communication improvements
- `solution_by_ops` — Operational policy adjustments
- `call_reason` → `granular_theme_l5` — Call reason hierarchy for context

## Analysis Framework

### Step 1: Policy Area Classification
- **Fee policies** — charges, waivers, fee structures, hidden fees
- **Limit policies** — transaction limits, withdrawal limits, transfer caps
- **Eligibility policies** — product eligibility, feature access, geographic restrictions
- **Compliance policies** — KYC requirements, regulatory mandates, documentation
- **Service policies** — SLA commitments, resolution timelines, service guarantees

### Step 2: Friction Type Assessment
- **Clarity** — policy is unclear, jargon-heavy, or contradictory
- **Awareness** — customer didn't know the policy existed
- **Fairness perception** — customer feels the policy is unreasonable
- **Enforcement inconsistency** — policy applied differently in different cases
- **Exception handling** — rigid application with no flexibility for edge cases

### Step 3: Communication Gap Analysis
- Are policies communicated proactively or only when violated?
- Is policy language customer-friendly or legalistic?
- Are policy changes communicated with sufficient notice?
- Do agents explain policies consistently?
- Are policy details accessible in digital channels?

### Step 4: Solution Mapping
- **Communication** — plain-language policy summaries, proactive notifications
- **Education** — in-app policy explainers, FAQs, contextual help
- **Ops** — clearer exception criteria, empowerment for policy flexibility
- **Policy reform** — simplify policies, align with customer expectations

## Investigation Questions
1. What are the top policy friction areas by volume?
2. What percentage of policy calls are about awareness vs disagreement?
3. Which policies generate the most customer frustration?
4. Are policy exceptions handled consistently?
5. How often do agents need to explain the same policy to the same customer?
6. Which policies could be simplified without business risk?
7. Are digital channels effectively communicating relevant policies?
