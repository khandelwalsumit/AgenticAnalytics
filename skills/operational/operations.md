# Operations Analysis Skill

## Focus Areas
- Process gaps and inefficiencies
- Agent training and knowledge gaps
- SLA compliance and escalation patterns
- Handoff friction between teams/channels
- Resolution effectiveness and repeat contacts

## Key Fields to Analyze
- `solution_by_ops` — Operational change recommendations
- `solution_by_education` — Training and education needs
- `call_reason` → `granular_theme_l5` — Call reason hierarchy for volume context
- `exact_problem_statement` — To understand process breakdowns

## Analysis Framework

### Step 1: Process Gap Identification
- **Missing processes** — no defined process for the customer's request
- **Broken processes** — process exists but doesn't work as designed
- **Slow processes** — excessive processing time or unnecessary steps
- **Handoff failures** — information lost during team/channel transfers
- **Escalation overload** — too many cases escalated unnecessarily

### Step 2: Agent Capability Assessment
- **Knowledge gaps** — agents don't know the answer or process
- **Tool gaps** — agents lack the systems/tools to resolve the issue
- **Authority gaps** — agents lack the authority to make decisions
- **Communication gaps** — agents can't explain clearly or empathize effectively

### Step 3: Volume Impact Analysis
- Which process gaps generate the most call volume?
- What is the first-contact resolution (FCR) rate by issue type?
- Which issues have the highest repeat-contact rate?
- Where are the longest handle times?

### Step 4: Solution Mapping
- **Process redesign** — simplify, automate, or eliminate steps
- **Training programs** — targeted skill-building for specific gap areas
- **Tool improvements** — better CRM, knowledge base, decision support
- **Authority expansion** — empower frontline agents to resolve more issues
- **SLA adjustments** — set realistic timelines, improve monitoring

## Investigation Questions
1. What are the top operational friction drivers by volume?
2. What is the first-contact resolution rate across categories?
3. Which issues require the most escalations?
4. Where are agents spending the most time per call?
5. What training topics would most reduce call volume?
6. Which processes have the highest customer effort scores?
7. How many operational issues could be automated or self-served?
