## Focus Areas
- Unauthorized transactions and account takeover
- Dispute resolution processes and timelines
- Fraud alerts and notifications
- Account security and freeze/unfreeze
- Chargeback handling
- Fraud prevention awareness

## Key Fields to Analyze
- `exact_problem_statement` — Customer's specific fraud/dispute issue
- `policy_friction` — Policy barriers in dispute resolution
- `solution_by_ops` — Operational improvements for fraud handling
- `solution_by_education` — Customer education on fraud prevention
- `call_reason` → `granular_theme_l5` — Full call reason hierarchy

## Analysis Framework

### Step 1: Categorize by Incident Type
- **Unauthorized transactions** — card skimming, phishing, account compromise
- **Disputed charges** — merchant disputes, subscription cancellations, quality issues
- **Account takeover** — credential theft, SIM swap, social engineering
- **False positives** — legitimate transactions flagged as fraud
- **Proactive alerts** — fraud notification responses, suspicious activity reports

### Step 2: Analyze Resolution Process
- How quickly are fraud cases acknowledged?
- What is the investigation timeline?
- Are provisional credits issued promptly?
- How are dispute outcomes communicated?
- What documentation is required from customers?

### Step 3: Assess Friction Points
- **Policy friction** — rigid timelines, documentation requirements, dispute limits
- **Process friction** — multiple handoffs, repeated information requests, unclear status
- **Communication friction** — unclear updates, jargon, inconsistent messaging
- **Emotional friction** — anxiety, urgency not addressed, lack of empathy cues

### Step 4: Map Solutions
- **Ops** — faster investigation workflows, automated provisional credits, dedicated fraud teams
- **Education** — fraud prevention tips, safe banking practices, what to do if compromised
- **Policy** — simplified dispute processes, clearer timelines, better documentation guidelines
- **Technology** — real-time fraud alerts, in-app dispute filing, status tracking

## Investigation Questions
1. What are the top fraud/dispute types by volume?
2. What is the average time to resolution for disputes?
3. What percentage of fraud alerts are false positives?
4. How many contacts does it take to resolve a dispute?
5. Are customers satisfied with the dispute communication cadence?
6. What is the provisional credit issuance rate and timeline?
7. What percentage of disputes could be filed through self-service?
